# saxtal

NOTE: In order to install the saxtal env on another computer, run:

conda env create -f environment.yml


TODO list:

2. Restructure program to take command line arguments


Minor:
- Write helper function to plot indices of detected spots
- Implement pyFFTW use as a flag, test overall script execution time
