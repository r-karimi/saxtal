# saxtal

NOTE: In order to install the saxtal env on another computer, run:

conda env create -f environment.yml


TODO list:

1. Test applying masking to individual frames from patch average, then going to per-particle alignment

2. Restructure program to take command line arguments

3. Implement pyFFTW as a flag, test overall script execution time
